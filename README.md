# Information-Retrieval

<h2>Topic Modelling and Clustering</h2>  
<h3>https://github.com/snmsoodan/Information-Retrieval/tree/master/IR/hw8</h3>
Performed LDA on a dataset of 85k documents to obtain representation of all documents into 200 topics using Machine Learning 
libraries in Java-Mallet.Then applied Density-Based Clustering using Python scikit-learn library, where every document gets 
assigned exactly one cluster out of total 25 clusters.Compared and achieved partitioning with existing query-document assignment 
for 25 queries to create a confusion matrix,achieving 88% accuracy.

<h2>Spam Classifier</h2>  
<h3>https://github.com/snmsoodan/Information-Retrieval/tree/master/IR/hw5</h3>
Developed a spam classifier using logistic regression.The classifier was trained on 65000 documents and achieved accuracy of 99% 
for prediction of 15000 documents.


<h3>Page Rank</h2>   
<h2>https://github.com/snmsoodan/Information-Retrieval/tree/master/IR/hw4</h3>
Implemented PageRank, a link analysis algorithm, in Java to get top 100 Webpages from the crawled data.
Implemented HITS, Hyperlink-Induces Topic Search, which estimates the authority and the hub value of each crawled page.


<h2>Web Crawler</h2> 
<h3>https://github.com/snmsoodan/Information-Retrieval/tree/master/IR/hw3</h3>
The Web Crawler, systematically crawled the world wide web to construct a relevant document collection focused on a particular topic and then created a vertical search engine using ElasticSearch. 
Crawled from seed page up to specified maximum depth by implementing politeness policy
